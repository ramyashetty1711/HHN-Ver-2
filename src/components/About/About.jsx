            About The Grid Converter
          </h4>

          <div className="px-4 font-medium pb-8">
            This Grid Converter is state-of-the-art positioning equipment made
            using Elena's multi-GNSS processor, which utilizes NavIC, GPS, and
            GLONASS to provide one-meter accuracy without any external support.
            It follows Elena's integrated approach. This equipment serves as a
            bridge between three reference systems used by the Indian Army, such
            as the ESM India grid system, the new DSM grid system, and the
            latitude-longitude (Lat-Long) system. It accurately provides all
            these reference numbers for the same point in various formats and
            can convert the reference from one system to another accurately.
