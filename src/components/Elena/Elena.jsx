                  As the only Indian company that provides complete NavIC-based
                  solutions, Elena Geo demonstrates unmatched expertise,
                  reliability, and innovation in this niche sector. The
                  company's alignment with the government's Atma Nirbharta
                  (self-reliance) initiative further accelerates the
                  commercialization of Indian navigation systems. Elena Geo
                  keeps a stock of 10000 nos of NavIC processor so as to cater
                  to the Indian market demand, especially the defence sector so
                  that there is no dearth of supply of NavIC processors. The use
                  of these products and technology shall account towards a huge
                  import savings to the Govt Exchequer, approximately to the
                  tune of Rs 1000 Crores. Elena Geo has conceived and developed
                  NavIC Navigator and NavIC Atomic Clock using 5G under the DCIS
                  scheme sponsored by DoT in 2021 and 2022 respectively.
